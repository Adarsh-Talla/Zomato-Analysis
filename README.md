# Zomato-Analysis
  Aim of the project: The aim is to construct a consolidated and interactive PowerBI report that will allow Zomato to quickly assess the required data.  
1.	Derive data on the total number of restaurants worldwide, including continents, countries, and cities
2.	View data on a global scale with the capacity to drill down to a granular level
3.	Derive data on the restaurants with the highest average customer ratings
4.	Discover the restaurants with the lowest average costs
5.	Filter and view information on the restaurants based on:
•	Their geographical dimensions such as continent, country, and city.
•	The service they provide, such as online ordering or reservation services
•	The average rating slab by the color
.6. Identify the restaurants with the most cuisines served
 7. Design a multi-page report that suits Zomato's theme with easy navigation across sections.
 8. Allow Zomato users to be able to access this information from both a web browser and a mobile device.
